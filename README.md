# Exploratory Data Analysis on Uk Census data snapshot

An investigation into the UK census snapshot dataset is undertaken to derive insights, leveraging R programming tools. Commencing with the importation of essential packages such as ggplot(Wickham 2016) for visualisation, tidyverse(Wickham et al. 2019) to better transform and present our data, various other packages were were utilised. The project involves an initial exploration of the dataset. R programming serves as a crucial tool, facilitating a profound grasp of the science of data and augmenting analytical capabilities(Crawley 2012).
